Installation
============

`Poetry <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry>`_ is used to manage the python development environment.

A simple way to create an environment with the desired version of python and poetry is to use `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.
E.g.::

    conda create -n fgpyo python=3.6 poetry
    conda activate fgpyo
    poetry install

If, during `poetry install` on Mac OS X errors are encountered running gcc/clang to build `pybedtools` or other packages with native code, try setting the following and re-running `poetry install`::

    export CFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++"
