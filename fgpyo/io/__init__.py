Module for reading and writing files
------------------------------------

The functions in this module make it easy to:

* check if a file exists and is writeable
* check if a file and its parent directories exist and are writeable
* check if a file exists and is readable
* check if a path exists and is a directory
* open an appropriate reader or writer based on the file extension
* write items to a file, one per line
* read lines from a file

fgpyo.io Examples:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import fgpyo.io as fio
    >>> from pathlib import Path
    Assert that a path exists and is readable
    >>> path_flat: Path = Path("example.txt")
    >>> path_compressed: Path = Path("example.txt.gz")
    >>> fio.path_is_readable(path_flat)
    AssertionError: Cannot read non-existent path: example.txt
    >>> fio.path_is_readable(compressed_file)
    AssertionError: Cannot read non-existent path: example.txt.gz
    Write to and read from path
    >>> write_lines(path = path_flat, lines_to_write=["flat file", 10])
    >>> write_lines(path = path_compressed, lines_to_write=["gzip file", 10])
    Read lines from a path into a generator
    >>> lines = read_lines(path = path_flat)
    >>> next(lines)
    "flat file"
    >>> next(lines)
    "10"
    >>> lines = read_lines(path = path_compressed)
    >>> next(lines)
    "gzip file"
    >>> next(lines)
    "10"
